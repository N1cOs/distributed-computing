# Purpose
This repository contains programming assignments for the distributed computing class. 
Each assignment is contained in a separate branch:
1. [pa1](https://github.com/N1cOs/distributed-computing/tree/pa1) - just model of a distributed system
2. [pa2](https://github.com/N1cOs/distributed-computing/tree/pa2) - banking system with physical time
3. [pa3](https://github.com/N1cOs/distributed-computing/tree/pa3) - banking system with Lamport timestamps
4. [pa4](https://github.com/N1cOs/distributed-computing/tree/pa4) - Lamport algorithm for mutual exclusion
5. [pa5](https://github.com/N1cOs/distributed-computing/tree/pa5) - Ricartâ€“Agrawala algorithm for mutual exclusion
